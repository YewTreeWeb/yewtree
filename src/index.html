    review: "Dedicated is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Mat . I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Mat
    for 2 years, during which I worked with him in the digital team at Gough Bailey Wright. Above all, I was impressed
    with Mat’s ability to build WordPress websites using is own custom built theme rather than use an off-the-shelf
    them. And, of course, his/her passion for web development in general. Mat would be a true asset for any positions
    requiring web design and development expertise, especially when it comes to WordPress website builds and comes with
    my heartfelt recommendation."

    review: "Working with Mat has been an absolute pleasure, and his web development skills are second-to-none. I’ve
    learned so much from Mat through the many projects we’ve worked on together, from frameworks to task runners to the
    best coding techniques - Which brings me onto what I admire most about Mat, and that’s the way he always finds the
    time to help you if you need it. Mat would be an asset to any employer and I can recommend him without reservation.
