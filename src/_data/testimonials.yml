  review: "Dedicated is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Mat . I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Mat for 2 years, during which I worked with him in the digital team at Gough Bailey Wright. Above all, I was impressed with Mat’s ability to build WordPress websites using is own custom built theme rather than use an off-the-shelf them. And, of course, his/her passion for web development in general. Mat would be a true asset for any positions requiring web design and development expertise, especially when it comes to WordPress website builds and comes with my heartfelt recommendation."

  review: "Working with Mat has been an absolute pleasure, and his web development skills are second-to-none. I’ve learned so much from Mat through the many projects we’ve worked on together, from frameworks to task runners to the best coding techniques - Which brings me onto what I admire most about Mat, and that’s the way he always finds the time to help you if you need it. Mat would be an asset to any employer and I can recommend him without reservation. See less"

  review: "I was lucky enough to work with Mat for just under 12 months, he is a hard-working, highly intelligent individual who always strives for perfection in his work. His thirst for knowledge is incredible and he would often come in to work after the weekend having learnt yet another framework or technology. Mat is certain to have a long and successful career in development and I'm glad to have played a small role in it."
